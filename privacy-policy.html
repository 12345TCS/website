It is clarified that this condition shall not apply to publicly available information, including SPI, in relation to you on the Website.</p>
        <p>However, you acknowledge that in the course of providing the Services, CloudMagician may receive SPI, either when you voluntarily choose to update your profile with information related to your identity, physical and physiological condition or financial information, or from such content posted by you on the Website, and you hereby consent and agree to allow CloudMagician to store and display the SPI collected in this manner on the Website and disclose it in accordance with the terms of this Policy.</p>
        <p>It is clarified that with respect to any SPI that you may share with CloudMagician, you have the sole right to determine whether you want to share such information with CloudMagician and/or the Clients, and that you can continue to avail of the Services without the sharing of any SPI. Further, with respect to any SPI that you may share in the course of updating your profile, you have the right to determine the levels of access to such information, by adjusting the privacy settings of your account with the Website.</p>
        <p>In this regard, if you choose to maintain a private profile on the Website, any SPI that you share will be collected only by CloudMagician and may be used to collate statistics or provide Services that you request, but will not be shared with other users of the Website without your consent or unless otherwise required by law. If you choose to maintain a public profile, any SPI you share on your profile or on any public forum, feed or journal, may also be accessed by any visitors to the Website.</p>
        <br><br>
        <b><h4>4. Personal Information</h4></b>

        <br><br>
        <b><h4>5. Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h4></b>
        <br>
        <p>Some of our web pages may also utilise “cookies” and other tracking technologies. A “cookie” is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about your activity on our Website. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information previously indicated by you. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you may need to re-enter your Personal Information to gain access to certain parts of our Website.</p>
        <p>Tracking technologies may automatically record information such as Internet domain and host names; other information about your geographic location; IP addresses; browser software and operating system types; CPU type; your manner of connecting to the Internet (e.g., connection speed through narrowband or broadband access); click paths; and dates and times that our Website is accessed.</p>
        <p>Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies allows us to improve our Website and consequently your experience using the Website and the Services. We may also analyse information that does not include Personal Information for trends and statistics.</p>
        <br><br>
        <b><h4>6. Uses of Personal Information</h4></b>
        <br>
        <p>We may use Personal Information and other information received and collected from you to provide the Services you have requested (including sharing your profile with Clients), to enable you to access and update your profile on the Website, or any part thereof, and to contact you upon your request and when otherwise necessary. We may also use Personal Information for auditing, research and analysis, and to operate and improve our Services. In certain circumstances, we may share aggregated non-personal information with third parties. When we use third parties to assist us in processing your Personal Information, we require that they comply with our Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We may also share such information with third parties in limited circumstances, including when complying with legal process, preventing fraud or imminent harm, and ensuring the security of our network and services.</p>
        <p>Where we propose to use your Personal Information for any other uses we will ensure that we notify you first. You will also be given the opportunity to withhold or withdraw your consent for your use other than as listed above.</p>
        <br><br>
        <b><h4>7. Confidentiality and Security</h4></b>
        <br>
        <p>We will keep confidential and protect your SPI and Personal Information except where disclosure is required or permitted by law or in instances where use and disclosure thereof is permitted under this Policy.</p>
        <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the SPI and Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and, once we receive it, for storage and disposal. All information we gather is securely stored within databases controlled by us. The databases are stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password protected and is strictly limited. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information and SPI, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <p>If you click on a link to a third party site or otherwise leave the Website, you will go to a website that is outside the purview of our control. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your Personal Information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as we do. The use of Personal Information by such websites shall be governed by the privacy policies provided therein. Therefore, if you visit a third party website that is linked to our Website, you should consult that website's privacy policy before providing any Personal Information.</p>

        <br><br>
        <b><h4>10. Change of Control</h4></b>
        <br>
        <p>In the event that ownership or control of CloudMagician was to change, your SPI and Personal Information may be transferred. If such a transfer results in a material change in the nature of use of your SPI and Personal Information, CloudMagician will provide notice about the choices you have to decline to permit such a transfer of SPI and/or Personal Information, as the case may be.</p>
        <br><br>
